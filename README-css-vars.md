We just added a bunch of CSS variables for easier theming/styling. Still
a work in progress. 

Still open TODO:

 - theme colors
 - charts
 - resize handle
 - sidebar button (when closed)

I _think_ that's it. Also we need to check fidelity with our existing dark 
theme to make sure we haven't missed anything.
