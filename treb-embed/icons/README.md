
We're switching back to commercial icons (or whatever the appropriate 
description is for font-awesome), at least for the time being. 

Make sure we give appropriate credit.

Here's the plan: put any icons you want to use in here. We'll have a build
script to whatever operations we want to convert them to JSON or whatever.

In the event we need multiple sources (something is missing), use folders
to identify them. We'll add prefixes for folders.
