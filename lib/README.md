In an effort to split TREB apart a little bit, and make the components
more usable by other apps, I am moving components into this lib dir; anything
in lib should be standalone and importable as a library.

Note that (atm) I am not transpiling or bundling these in any way; they're 
intended to be consumed as typescript (assuming that works).
