One of the nice things about the monorepo is that we can centralize on a single
todo list, instead of scattering among projects.

grid/sheet
----------

 + named ranges
   - needs to be accessible to sheet for context highlighting
   - needs to be accessible to calculator for function resolution
   - (the above two suggest putting it in the 'sheet' object)
   - needs to adjust for add/remove rows/columns

 + redo

meta
----

 + export modules
 + clean up dependency structure so format is easier to reuse
